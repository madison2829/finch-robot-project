# Final Project: Finch Robot Challenges

## Essential Question
How can we apply object-oriented programming principles and Java concepts to create interactive, autonomous robot behaviors that solve real-world challenges?

## Project Overview
In this project-based learning experience, you will program a Finch 2.0 robot to perform one of three challenges:
1. Choreograph a dance routine (with movement, lights, and sound)
2. Create an artistic drawing using the robot's movements
3. Navigate a maze autonomously

Your program must demonstrate your understanding of Java programming concepts from APCSA and object-oriented design principles while creating an engaging robot behavior.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply Java programming concepts in a physical computing context
- Implement object-oriented design principles
- Develop problem-solving skills through algorithm development
- Create well-documented and maintainable code
- Practice technical communication through presentations and documentation

### Technical Requirements
Your program must include at least 5 of these Java/OOP concepts:
- Inheritance/Subclasses
- Method overloading or overriding
- Arrays or ArrayLists
- Loops (for, while, etc.)
- Conditional statements
- Exception handling
- File I/O for configuration or logging
- Constants and static methods
- User input processing

### Documentation Requirements
- Well-commented code with appropriate Javadoc
- GitHub repository with organized file structure
- README.md file including:
  * Project description and objectives
  * Description of design choices
  * Challenges faced and solutions
  * Future enhancements
  * Video or images of your robot in action (embedded or linked)

  ## Description of design choices
  We wanted to keep our finch robot simple and efficent. We edited the speed so the sensors would work more effectively but we ended up changing the speed to a lower number so the drift wouldnt affect our progress while running through the maze. The distance of the finch while it was moving forward would bump into walls ahead. So we edited the distance so it wouldnt ruin future progress. 
  ## Challenges faced and solutions
  Some challenges we faced we multitasking because we were too busy with other parts of this project that we didnt concentrate enough in the advanced coding aspect, and incorporate CSA foundations. We found a solution to this problem by looking at the rubric and ending all possible distractions around us. Another problem we encountered was that our robot would drift to the left while going straight, which would constantly ruin our progress. A solution we found was to find a constant we could use when setting the finch robot in the maze. We used the length of a finger to know the distance between the walls and the finch ended up going straight and not running into the walls after. 
  ## future enhancements
  Some future enhancement ideas we had was that when it completes a turn the beak changes its colors. When we reach the end of the maze, it plays music and starts dancing and the beak color changes rapidly.
